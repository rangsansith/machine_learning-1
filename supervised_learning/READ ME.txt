This document is created to demonstrate how to use the codes and data of supervised machine learning to generated 
related results.

code dir: .R code should be processed by R.  Related R package should be installed before executing the code.
.m code should be processed by Matlab.  The neural network toolbox in Matlab is used to generate related code.

data dir: 
winequality-red.csv,winequality-white.csv is the raw data I obtained. 
winequality-combine.csv is the combineddataset generated from the previous two datasets,
  adding type attribute to denote whether the wine is red wine or white wine.
winequality.names.txt gives the overall description of raw dataset.

graph dir:
All graphs used in the report paper are attached in the dir. Some graphs may not be used.
